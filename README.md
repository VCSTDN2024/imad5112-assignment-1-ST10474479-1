2. Project Overview

## Project Overview

The **Meal planner** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD module. This application was created using the **Kotlin** programming language through the application software **Android Studio**. 
The apps primary purpose is to help a user find quick and easy on the go meals suggestions especially if one had a busy schedule

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, that includes creating a operating mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

3. App Purpose and Features

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to [explain the app’s functionality]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: [Description of a feature, e.g., "User login functionality"]
- Feature 2: [Description of another feature, e.g., "Displaying weather data based on location"]
- Feature 3: [Optional, another feature, e.g., "Push notifications for reminders"]

These features aim to provide [what the app aims to achieve, e.g., an easy-to-use platform for managing tasks or organizing personal information].


4. Design Considerations

## Design Considerations

The design of the **[App Title]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

7. Challenges and Learnings

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Briefly describe a challenge you faced, e.g., "Implementing a complex feature like the login system."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I researched Firebase authentication and successfully integrated it into the app."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Debugging issues related to Gradle builds."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

8. Future Enhancements

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Description, e.g., "Allowing users to set up reminders or notifications."]
2. **Feature 2**: [Description, e.g., "Integrating with a cloud database for storing user data."]
3. **Feature 3**: [Description, e.g., "Adding a dark mode option for better user experience."]

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
