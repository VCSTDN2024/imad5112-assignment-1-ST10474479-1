2. Project Overview

## Project Overview

The **Meal planner** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD module. This application was created using the **Kotlin** programming language through the application software **Android Studio**. 
The apps primary purpose is to help a user find quick and easy on the go meals suggestions especially if one had a busy schedule

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, that includes creating a operating mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

3. App Purpose and Features

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to to output meals based on the time of day the user inputs.This makes things easier as the user does not have to struggle to think of what to make if they are in a rush somewhere or have a hectic schedule.

### Key Features:
- Features: EditText where user is able to input the time of day in which they want a meal for then it is displayed.
- Features: Reset button to clear the meals displayed in the textview so the user can input another time of day.
- Features: Exit button to exit the program once the user is satisfied and has been given a meal
  
These features aim to provide a simple easy user friendly interface and very easy for managing tasks.


4. Design Considerations

## Design Considerations

The design of the **Bees Meal Plan** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring an enjoyable user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Effectiveness**: The design is simple, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **High Performance**: Code upgrade was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

7. Challenges and Learnings

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: Had challenges with my background as it was not showing
   - **Solution**: Had to like my xml file with my mainactivity
   
2. **Challenge 2**: Issue with my GitHubAction utilization
   - **Solution**: Was given a new code as the old one was outdated and the new one worked

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

8. Future Enhancements

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: Adding more buttons and screens so that the user is able to press on a button and it takes them to another screen to see the options of the food that were shown in the display
2. **Feature 2**: Adding a sign in page so the users information is saved and is secure and safe to use the app
3. **Feature 3**: Dark mode for better user experience at night

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for every user.
